# LazyLiterature

This was an assignment we had to complete in CSC108. Essentially, the file takes in a piece of literature, and then creates a dictionary that associates words that appear after eachother as a pair. The final result is not always correct grammarly, but yet it creates something in a similar style of the piece of literature it is given. Alice in Wonderland is presented as an example.
